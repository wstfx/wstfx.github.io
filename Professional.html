										<h2>Purpose & Fit</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I’m building a career at the intersection of technology, business, and human impact. I don’t have formal industry experience yet; what I do have is a builder’s mindset, strong foundations in math, physics, coding, and modeling, and a deep curiosity about how ideas become products people actually use. I’m actively seeking high-quality internships or full-time roles where I can learn modern execution, contribute from day one, and grow with teams that ship real value.</p>
									<p>I thrive in environments that value curiosity, high standards, and kindness; that measure results; and that give young builders real ownership. If your team is shipping, learning, and improving the world a little each sprint, I’d love to contribute—bringing energy, accountability, and a clear bias to build.</p>

										<h2>Career Direction</h2>
									</header>
									<p>My interests—technology, investing, consulting, product/marketing, and data analysis—are not five unrelated paths; they are five vantage points on the same question: how does something new travel from a lab notebook to everyday life, repeatedly and responsibly? I want to see the full arc—discovery, design, manufacturing, go-to-market, iteration—and understand how organizations coordinate people, capital, and information to make that arc reliable.</p>
									<p>From the investing lens, I’m drawn to disciplined curiosity. Studying markets, incentives, and unit economics builds the habit of forming testable theses: not just “is this cool?” but “will this create durable cash flows, at scale, given real constraints?” That perspective keeps my engineering and product choices grounded in how the world actually works rather than in hype cycles.</p>
									<p>From the consulting lens, I see creative engineering inside living systems. The work is to step into operations, map constraints, remove bottlenecks, and deliver measurable gains in throughput, service, and cost. Improving a plant’s schedule adherence or a network’s short-haul rates is more than an enterprise win—it is productivity returned to people and communities. That mission motivates me.</p>
									<p>From the technology and product lens, I love building things people can use today. Product sits where empathy meets systems thinking: listen carefully, translate needs into architecture and interfaces, ship thoughtfully, and iterate until outcomes improve. Marketing and product management close the loop by turning insight into positioning, roadmaps, and timing so that the right thing reaches the right users at the right moment.</p>
									<p>From the data analysis lens, I care about making the whole loop honest. Clean pipelines, trustworthy metrics, and causal tests reveal what actually moved the needle; evidence beats opinion and makes learning faster. This is also why I’m excited about the human–machine future: digital, mechanical, and intelligent tools that amplify human work. I want to help design reliable, explainable systems where people stay in control and the gains show up in real life—safer processes, clearer decisions, and more time for the work that matters.</p>
									<p>Put simply, my career preference is to be where ideas meet operations and users—to help organizations commercialize high-tech responsibly, improve how products are designed and manufactured, and keep learning at the interface of engineering, economics, and design.</p>

										<h2>How I Work & What I Bring</h2>
									</header>
									<p>My learning strategy is wide and connected. I start from first principles across fields and then combine them. Patterns repeat between physics and operations, between design and optimization; when those patterns click, you get better intuitions, cleaner abstractions, and simpler solutions that scale. I prototype quickly, instrument carefully, learn in public, and iterate with purpose. I’m forward-leaning on responsibility and comfortable owning problems end to end.</p>
									<p>Today I bring a solid quantitative toolkit; hands-on experience with AI/ML, simulation, and VR prototyping; and clean, reproducible workflows in Python, PyTorch, C++, and Verilog. I communicate clearly—from slide to spreadsheet to script—and I enjoy the full stack of work: scoping a question, building the model or system, validating with data, and translating results into decisions. More than anything, I bring energy and consistency: show up, do the hard thinking, and keep moving until the work is useful.</p>
