										<h3>Overall Feelings</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I chose Westlake because I was genuinely moved by its founding story—an ambitious, research-driven university that promised room to build something new. When I arrived, that belief turned into a year-long burst of energy. I threw myself into everything: classes, student union work, campus tours for visitors, volunteering, and late-night self-study in tools I’d never touched before—Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects. I felt like I could help write a small line of the school’s history.</p>

									<p>My second year was a turning point. I ran into the less romantic, more bureaucratic side of student life. Some decisions felt top-down; thoughtful feedback sometimes went unanswered. Instead of burning out, I rebalanced. I focused more deeply on academics and on work where effort maps directly to learning and impact. That shift sharpened my interests: I found myself drawn to economics, operations, and the broader social context around technology, and I kept building analytical habits in labs and projects.</p>

											<p>In Fall 2025 I came to Cornell as an exchange student. The community here feels intensely international and collaborative—you encounter different ways of thinking in every project team. I’m sampling courses beyond ECE—operations research, behavioral economics, even a PE in bowling because it’s delightfully American. Ithaca’s rhythm is different too: quieter, greener, full of small events that make weeks feel human. Being here has reinforced a longer-term direction for me: I care about the bridge between technical work and real-world value—how ideas get operationalized, scaled, and commercialized so that people can feel the benefits.</p>

									</section>
									<p>I didn’t start with a perfectly defined research agenda. Westlake encourages every undergraduate to join a lab, so I began by learning how research is actually done. I joined an AI-for-Science group focused on materials discovery. My first months were apprenticeship: reading, reproducing code, and getting comfortable with the practical backbone of ML work—Conda environments, SSH, GitHub workflows, and keeping experiments reproducible. We explored diffusion-based generative pipelines for inverse crystal design, and I learned how ideas move from paper to a working code path.</p>
									<p>Out of a personal itch I spun up an ASR training project (as a stepping stone to an audio-based mosquito detector). Cleaning and relabeling data to match a model’s pretraining regime sounds unglamorous, but it taught me a core lesson: small, correct choices on data often move accuracy more than another clever tweak. Seeing recognition performance jump after the relabeling pass made that point very real.</p>
									<p>I then wandered, deliberately, through active learning. I prototyped a neural-network/RL query policy for operator error reduction and ran into the usual gremlins—catastrophic forgetting, data hunger, brittle gains. I pivoted to a semi-supervised, error-prediction angle and got promising but incremental results. That chapter mattered because it matured my taste: I learned the difference between “clever” and “consequential,” and why publication-worthy work often starts from problem selection, not just method invention.</p>
									<p>Recently my projects have become more grounded. At Westlake I’ve been learning ABAQUS to study creep at lattice scales and implementing symmetry constraints to keep simulations physically honest. At Cornell, in the Virtual Embodiment Lab, I’m helping design a VR teaching experience for special relativity—verifying the physics, tuning interaction flow, and measuring whether students actually understand more by the end. Both lines scratch the same itch: take rigorous ideas, respect the constraints that make them true, and build something people can learn from or use.</p>
									<p>Why this path makes sense for me: I value research that changes how someone does a task tomorrow—better decisions, clearer understanding, safer processes, smoother operations. I’m less attached to any single subfield than to that through-line of tangible effect.</p>

										<h3>Campus Involvement</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Early on I poured energy into the College Student Union and the Cultural Construction Department. I designed posters, shot and edited videos, and helped organize on-campus events; those projects taught me pace, polish, and the unglamorous logistics behind “it just works.” As a student ambassador I guided visitors around campus and learned to articulate why I chose Westlake and what kind of community I wanted to help build. Later I led planning rhythms—biweekly reports and term-end summaries—so that events didn’t just happen; they improved.</p>
									<p>When I stepped back from some roles, it wasn’t withdrawal so much as focus. I kept contributing where I could be effective and shifted time into labs, courses, and writing. At Cornell my involvement is anchored in research groups and cross-disciplinary teams, where the campus feels like a mesh of small, serious communities. That mix—hands-on student work, candid feedback about institutions, and steadily deeper academic projects—has made my university years feel honest. I arrived eager to do everything; I’m leaving with a clearer sense of what I do well, why it matters, and where I want to take it next.</p>

										<h3>Early years</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I grew up in China and went through a very traditional school track. After kindergarten I attended public schools, did the usual kid things, and—thanks to my parents—tried a lot beyond the core subjects. Instead of cramming after class for Chinese/Math/English, I spent afternoons in “interest” courses: drawing, calligraphy, creative thinking, and team sports like football and basketball. That mix kept school from feeling narrow. I wasn’t the type who chased every extra point; I learned to stay curious and to enjoy learning for its own sake.</p>
								</section>
								
								<section>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>Middle school</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Middle school raised the stakes. Our school ran monthly exams across the grade, publishing total scores and rankings. I didn’t start near the top. In science, I even had a rough patch that ended with a teacher calling out my performance in front of the class—then inviting me to her office to work through problems one-on-one. That kindness changed a lot. I began dropping by to ask questions, and physics/chemistry started to click. Math followed. English came fairly naturally, while Chinese (literature, composition) lagged a bit. Within a couple of months my rank moved into the top 20, then the top 10.</p>
									<p>It wasn’t all studying. We were supposed to take a midday nap in the dorms; many days my friends and I slipped to the playground to shoot hoops. I also had a mischievous streak that occasionally put me at odds with rule-keeping teachers, but even that taught me something about boundaries and responsibility.</p>
								</section>

										<h3>High school</h3>
									</header>
									<p>High school felt louder: more students, more rules, more competition—and more voices saying your exam score defines your worth. I never fully bought into that. Some classmates studied past midnight, chasing one or two extra points; I questioned whether those points actually mattered for becoming the person you want to be. That tension made my grades wobble at first. Over time I stabilized, but I kept looking for a path that valued understanding over point-collecting.</p>
								</section>
								
								<section>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>Olympiad training</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I found that path, briefly, in physics Olympiad training. Our coaching wasn’t perfect, but something in second year flipped a switch. Classical mechanics stopped being a bag of formulas and became a system: starting from Newton’s second law you can derive so much of the machinery. That view—physics as a coherent language—was mind-opening. Olympiad problems pulled in university-level math/physics early, and that foundation paid dividends later.</p>
									<p>My competition result wasn’t what I hoped, which meant stepping back to the regular track. But the experience left me with two habits: learn concepts “from first principles,” and enjoy the grind of making ideas precise.</p>
								</section>
								
								<section>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>The Gaokao sprint</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Because I’d devoted a year to Olympiad training, I returned to the standard curriculum with only about 100 days before the Gaokao. I’d forgotten a lot of test-specific content. That’s where Olympiad habits saved me. I built a self-teaching plan, filled gaps quickly, and watched my scores climb. On the Gaokao I finished 1,101 out of roughly 300,000 candidates in my province—about the top 0.37%—which opened doors to several top universities.</p>

										<h3>Choosing Westlake</h3>
									</header>
									<p>With those options on the table, I faced a deeper question: did I want to stay in the same score-centric loop, only at a larger scale? By then I was tired of the idea that “higher score = better person.” I’d started reading about Westlake University, a young, research-driven institution focused on STEM, promising a cleaner academic environment and more space for students to grow into builders rather than point-collectors. The story resonated. I applied, sat the admissions process, and chose Westlake—turning down more established names.</p>
									<p>It wasn’t a naïve leap. I knew a new university would have gaps, and I’ve since learned that every institution has bureaucracy and blind spots. Still, I don’t regret the choice. What drew me to Westlake was the chance to step outside the rankings game and join a place trying to do higher education differently. That decision set up everything that came after: the first-year burst of campus involvement, the shift toward research when I needed more substance, and eventually the exchange to Cornell to round out the human side of a STEM education.</p>

									<header class="major">
										<h3>What I carried forward</h3>
									</header>
									<p>From those pre-university years I took a few lasting threads. Curiosity beats compliance. A good mentor’s door—like my middle-school science teacher’s—can change your trajectory. Depth matters more than points when you’re trying to build something real. And when a system feels too tight, it’s possible to choose a different one. Those lessons guided me into Westlake, and they still shape how I learn and what I want my work to do.</p>
